### Abstract


### Introduction and Motivation
The key quality in measuring the outcome of researches and experiments is whether results in a paper can be attained by a different research team, using the same methods. Results presented in scientific articles may sometimes seem revolutionary, but there is very little use if it was just a single case impossible to reproduce.  The closeness of agreement among repeated measurements of a variable made under the same operating conditions by different people, or over a period of time is what researches must bear in mind. @Peng1226 leading author of the commentary and an advocate for making research reproducible by others, insists reproducibility should be a minimal standard.

There have been several reproducibility definitions proposed during the last decades. @gentleman2007statistical suggest that by reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper. The second definition is according to @vandewalle2009reproducible, research work is called reproducible if all information relevant to the work, including, but not limited to, text, data, and code, is made available, such that an independent researcher can reproduce the results. As said by @leveque2009python the idea of ‘reproducible research’ in scientific computing is to archive and make publicly available all the codes used to create a paper’s figures or tables, preferably in such a manner that readers can download the codes and run them to reproduce the results. All definitions converge into one consistent postulate - the data and code should be made available for others to view and use. The availability of all information related to research paper gives other investigators the opportunity to verify previously published findings, conduct alternative analyses of the same data, eliminate uninformed criticisms and most importantly - expedite the exchange of information among scientists.

Reproducibility has great importance not only in the academic world but also it also plays a significant role in the business. The concept of technological dept is often used to describe the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer in software development. 

There are papers about using version control systems to provide reproducible results [@stanisic2015an]. The authors presented how we can manage to maintain our goal of reproducibility using Git and Org-Mode. Other researchers have created a software package that is designed to create reproducible data analysis [@fomel2013madagascar]. They have created a package that contains computational modules, data processing scripts, and research papers. The package is build using the Unix principle to write programs that are simple and do well one thing. The program breaks big data analysis chains into small steps to ensure that everything is going in the right way. Some papers suggest using Docker to make sure our research can be reproduced [@hung2016guidock].

The main goal of our work is to measure the impact of the active development of packages on the reproducibility of scientific papers. Multiple authors [@rosenberg2020the; @kitzes2017practice] suggest using the version control system as a key feature in creating reproducible research. The second paper also provides evidence, that this is widely known. Git and GitHub were used in over 80% of cases. However, there are two kinds of using a version control system. An author can push software into the repository, to make it easily accessible and does not update it anymore. The second option is to keep the repository up-to-date and resolve users' issues. We have not found any research on how these two approaches impact reproducibility.
