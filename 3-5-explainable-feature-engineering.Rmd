### Abstract


### Introduction and Motivation

Linear regression is one of the simplest and the easiest to interpret of the predictive models. While it has already been thorougly analysed over the years (ref), there remain some unsolved questions. One such question is how to transform the data features in order to maximize the model's effectiveness in predicting the new data. An example of a known and widely used approach is the Box-Cox transformation of the target variable, which allows one to improve the model's performance with minimal increase in computational complexity. However, choice of the predictive features' transformations is often left to intuition and trial-and-error approach. In the article, we wish to compare various methods of features' transformations and compare the resulting models' performances while also comparing their computational complexities and differences in feature importance. 
Many black box regression models use various kinds of feature engineering during the training process. Unfortunately, even though the models perform better than the interpretable ones, they don't provide information about the transformations used and non-linear dependencies between variables and the target. The goal we want to achieve is extracting features and non-linearities with understandable transformations of the training dataset. To measure the improvement of used methods, we'll compare their performance metrics with black box models' as a ground truth. This will allow us to effectively measure which method brought the simple linear model closer to the black box. Also, we'll take under consideration the improvement of black box model performance. Thanks to this, our article will not only present the methods for creating highly performant interpretable models, but also improvement of the results of black box model.

### Related Work
There exist many papers related to feature engineering. We will shortly present few of them.

One of these papers is "Enhancing Regression Models for Complex Systems Using Evolutionary Techniques for Feature Engineering" Patricia Arroba, José L. Risco-Martín, Marina Zapater, José M. Moya & José L. Ayala. This paper describes, how feature transformations in linear regression can be chosen based on the genetic algorithms.

Another one is "Automatic feature engineering for regression models with machine learning: An evolutionary computation and statistics hybrid" Vinícius Veloso de Melo, Wolfgang Banzhaf. Similarly to the previous one, this paper tries to automate feature engineering using evolutionar computation to make a hybrid model - final model is simple linear regression while its features are found by more complex algorithm.

### Methodology
The main goal of our research is to compare various methods of transforming the data in order to improve the linear regression's performance. While we do not aim to derive an explicitly best solution to the problem, we wish to compare some known approaches and propose new ones, simultaneously verifying legitimacy of their usage. The second goal of the research is to compare the achieved models' performances with black box models to generally compare their effectiveness, having in mind that the linear regression remains highly interpretable. We also wish to compare the models feature importance to check for notable differences.

The main methods of feature transformation compared in the article include:

1. By-hand-transformations - we will use our expertise to derive possibly the best transformations of the dataset, but in this scenario we do not automate the process. Based on various visualizations, including, but not limited to residual plots, Feature Importance plots, Partial Dependency plots and Accumulated Dependency plots, we aim to maximize the model's performance by hand.

2. Brute Force method - this method of data transformation generates huge amount of additional features being transformations of the existing features. They include e.g. taking square of the variable value or multiplying two variables. While the method is known to provide good results, its complexity is much higher than other methods' and may lead to overfitting.

3. Bayesian Optimization method - we wish to treat the task of finding optimal data transformation as an optimization problem. Once we restrict the transformations e.g. by choosing maximal degree of a polynomial transformation of each variable, we may then search the possible models' space with the use of Bayesian Optimization in order to maximize their performance. This way we may also restrain the model from generating a lrage number of variables, while also hopefully yielding good results.

4. One of our ideas is to use GP (Genetic Programming) to find best feature transformations. We will create a set of simple operations such as adding, multiplying, taking a specific power, for example 2, taking logarithm and so on. Our goal is to minimize mean squared error of linear regression (ridge) after transformations. We will use one of the variations of the genetic algorithms to create an operation tree minimizing our goal. This method should find much better solutions without extending dimensionality too much or making too complex transformations. We will get linear regression with much better performance without loss of the interpretability. This method will teach linear regression many times, because in each generation each individual requires its own training. However, linear regressions are very fast even for datasets with many rows and many columns, thus computation complexity should not be a problem. Whole conception tries to automate feature enginnering done traditionally by hand. Another advantage is control of model complexity. We can stimulate how the operation trees are made, and reduce or increase complexity at will. Modification of this idea is to add regularization term decreasing survival probability with increasing complexity. At the end model could also make a feature selection in the same way - then one of possible operations in the set would be dropping.

The research is conducted on *Concrete_Data* dataset from the OpenML database. The data describes the amount of ingredients in the samples - cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, coarse aggregate and fine aggregate - in kilograms per cubic meter; it also contains the drying time of the samples in days, referred to as age. The target variable of the dataset is the compressive strength of each sample in megapascals (MPa), therefore rendering the task to be regressive. The dataset contains 1030 instances with no missing values. There are also no symbolic features, as we aim to investigate continuous transformations of the data.

We use standard and verified methods to compare results of the models. As the target variable is continuous, we may calculate Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared measures for each model, which provides us with proper and measurable way to compare the models' performances. The same measures may be applied to black box models. The feature importance measure used in the after-evaluation comparison is based on the permutation feature importance, easily applied to any predictive machine learning model and therefore not constraining us to choose from a restricted set. In order provide unbiased results, we calculate the measures' values during cross-validation process for each model, using various number of fold to present comparative results.

### Results

```{r, cache = FALSE}
require(rmarkdown, quietly = TRUE)
res <- read.csv("data/interpretability_3_5_results.csv", sep = ";")

```

As the results presented above show, brute force method has already surpassed all the black box models trained on the plain data, while by hand method yielded slightly worse results.
